DragonRuby GTK Log Messages. Set $gtk.log_level = :off to disable logging to the Console/HUD (log messages will still be written here). Log options are: :on, :off.
* INFO: Marked app/main.rb for reload. (-1)

Hello World!
Within the game *press the key that is directly to the left of "1" on the top row of your keyboard* to bring up the DragonRuby GTK Console.
After the console opens, type "help" and press the ENTER key to look around.
Don't worry. This notification will not be displayed when you release your game (it only displays during development).
